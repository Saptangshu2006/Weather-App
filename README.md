# Weather-App
This is an advanced weather application built entirely using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, without the use of any external libraries or frameworks. The app fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and presents it in a clean, responsive interface.

Users can enter the name of any city and instantly view comprehensive weather details such as:

🌡️ Current Temperature

🧊 Feels Like Temperature

💧 Humidity Level

🌬️ Wind Speed

☁️ Weather Description (e.g., clear sky, rain, snow)

🌍 Location (City + Country)

🖼️ Live Weather Icon (auto-updated based on weather conditions)

The app includes built-in error handling for invalid or misspelled city names and gives user-friendly feedback when something goes wrong. The UI is styled for a smooth and visually appealing experience across devices using CSS Flexbox, gradients, and card components. All features are optimized for fast, lightweight use with no dependency on frontend frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.

This project is a great demonstration of:

Working with RESTful APIs using fetch()

DOM manipulation in JavaScript

Clean and responsive UI design

Using live external data to drive frontend behavior
